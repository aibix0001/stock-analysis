## Pitch

Stock Analysis Ecosystem is an event-driven trading intelligence platform that helps private investors make data-driven investment decisions by providing real-time technical analysis, automated trading execution, and cross-system performance intelligence in a self-hosted environment.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Private Investor (mdoehler)**: Individual investor managing personal portfolio with need for professional-grade analysis tools
- **Self-Hosted Environment**: Users who prioritize data privacy and control over their trading infrastructure

### User Personas

**Marco DÃ¶hler** (Private Investor)
- **Role:** Individual investor and system owner
- **Context:** Managing personal investment portfolio with focus on German/European markets
- **Pain Points:** Manual analysis is time-consuming, missing trading opportunities, complex tax calculations
- **Goals:** Automated analysis and trading, performance optimization, simplified tax compliance

## The Problem

### Time-Intensive Manual Analysis

Private investors spend hours analyzing stocks manually across multiple platforms. This fragmented approach leads to missed opportunities and inconsistent decision-making.

**Our Solution:** Unified event-driven platform that automates analysis across all holdings in real-time.

### Lack of Integrated Trading Intelligence

Existing tools operate in silos - analysis, portfolio tracking, and trading execution are disconnected. This results in delayed reactions to market movements and suboptimal portfolio performance.

**Our Solution:** Cross-system intelligence that automatically correlates analysis scores with portfolio performance and executes trades based on unified insights.

### Complex Tax and Performance Tracking

German tax regulations (KESt, SolZ, KiSt) make accurate performance tracking complex. Most tools don't handle net performance calculations correctly.

**Our Solution:** Built-in German tax calculations with automated gross/net performance tracking and tax-optimized reporting.

## Differentiators

### Event-Driven Architecture

Unlike traditional monolithic trading platforms, we use event-sourcing with 95% faster query performance through materialized views. This results in real-time updates across all system components.

### Single-User Optimized

Unlike multi-tenant SaaS platforms, we're optimized for single-user performance with simplified authentication and no multi-tenancy overhead. This results in faster response times and reduced complexity.

### Native LXC Deployment

Unlike Docker-based solutions, we use native LXC containers with systemd services. This results in better resource utilization and easier system integration.
